It has already been a month since I took up my position as Mass and Pilgrimage Office Assistant here at the National Shrine and Basilica of Our Lady of Walsingham. I must confess that I didn’t expect that I would already have been working and living here in Walsingham for a whole month. Truly, time flies!

To be honest, I arrived at a very good time, as the main pilgrimage season here at the Walsingham Basilica will begin this coming March. This gives me a few months to learn and become familiar with all the arrangements and management related to the pilgrimages at the Basilica. I can’t wait to see many pilgrims coming here to pray before Our Lady of Walsingham.

Please continue to pray for my work here at the Walsingham Basilica!
