If you woke up this morning, with more health than illness, you are more blessed than the million who won't survive the week.

If you have never experienced the danger of the battle, the loneliness of imprisonment, the agony of torture or the pangs of starvation, you are ahead of 20 million people around the world.

If you attend a church meeting without fear of harassment, arrest, torture, or death, you are more blessed than almost three billion people in the world.

If you have food in your refrigerator, clothes on your back, a roof over your head and a place to sleep, you are richer than 75% of this world.

If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and spare change in a dish someplave, you are among the top 8% of the world's wealthy.

If your parents are still married and alive, you are very rare, especially in Hong Kong.

If you hold up your head with a smile on your face and are truly thankful, you are so blessed because the majority can, but most do not.

If you can hold someone's hand, hug them or even touch them on the shoulder, you are blessed because you can offer God's healing touch.

If you can read this message, you are more blessed then over two billion people in the world that cannot read anything at all.

You are so blessed in ways you may never even know.
