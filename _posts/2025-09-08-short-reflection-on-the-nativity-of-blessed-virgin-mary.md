In our Catholic Church's liturgical calendar, we celebrate 3 birthdays: The birthday of Jesus Christ, the birthday of St. John the Baptist, and the birthday of Blessed Virgin Mary, which we are celebrating today.

Every time we celebrating our mother's birthday, as a good children, we try to offer her a present, especially for me as a Chinese, in order to make the right choice of gift, you have to put yourself in your motherʹs place and think what she would love to have. And we know that, much more than material things, mothers long for affection, thoughtfulness. They love to have their children around and to see them happy. Thatʹs always the best gift for a mother and Mary is very much Our Mother.

Blessed Alvaro del Portillo, the former Prelate of Opus Dei, once told a story that can help us to reflect on the birthday of Mother Mary:

African Catholic family lived the custom of offering something special to Our Lady every day. At the end of the day, each member of the family would leave a note with their offering under a small image of Mary. The offerings were very simple: to study better, help a younger brother or sister, do their jobs, pray with more attention and devotion.

One day, however, the boy had a horrible day: he was especially lazy that day and was told off in school, he was disobedient, he had a few fights at home, he didnʹt finish his homework, and, finally, he was sent to bed without dinner. His mother thought he wouldnʹt dare to leave a note that day. But before she went to bed she checked and was surprised to see his note at the feet of Our Lady. She never read those notes, but that day she felt curious to know what he had written.

This is what the note said: ʺIʹm sorry, Mother. Iʹve done everything wrong today.ʺ

His mother was moved and so was Blessed Alvaro when telling the story, and, surely, so was Our Lady. Because mothers know that, even if we have nothing else to offer, contrition is a great present. 

Happy Birthday, Mother Mary!
