Someone just sends you a friend request on Facebook. Confirm? or Decline?

On Facebook. I often receive some friend requests from other people I do not immediately recall. For those who know me, I am not willing to confirm the request blindly. I worry that once I connect with a stranger, the stranger will use my connections to connect with my friends. If my friends are careless in accepting invitations, my blind confirmation will put my friend in jeopardy.

Therefore, if I do not recall the person immediately, I often look at their profile. If the profile brings some memory or tells some connection I have with the person in real life, a confirmation will be issued.

The problem is some people do not show much on their profile. A decline is almost immediate.

At other times, the profile tells something but is not enough for me to decide. In this case, I often message the person:

>Good day, xxx. Received your Facebook friend invitation. Glad but will need some basic information before I can accept your invitation. Do you mind giving me a brief self-introduction?

If a self-introduction is not received in a week, the invitation is deleted.

My dear Facebook friends, I hope you will adopt a similar strategy to protect me just as I do for you. Safe Facebooking!
