I have read a lot of comments on Facebook about whether Pope Leo XIV will reverse the Moto Proprio “Traditionis Custodes”, issued by the late Pope Francis back in July 2021.

Will it happen? It is a very good question, not just for me, but for many Catholics who value the rich traditions of the Church.

For me, I personally think Pope Leo XIV will probably lift the Traditional Latin Mass ban by canceling the “Traditionis Custodes”, because there are some reports that when Pope Leo XIV was still Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, he had been privately celebrating the Traditional Latin Mass in his private chapel in Rome, which was granted permission by Pope Francis himself. This detail suggests a certain openness to the traditional form of the liturgy, which many in the Catholic community continue to cherish.

Additionally, there are some photos of Cardinal Prevost wearing the Roman Chasuble with Pontifical Dalmatic. His choice of attire reflects a connection to the historic practices of the Church. When he was elected Pope, he chose to wear the traditional papal vestments such as Rochet and Mozzetta, further illustrating his affinity for traditional liturgy and practices. From that point, you can see Pope Leo XIV is quite a traditional guy. His actions and choices may resonate positively with those who long for a return to more traditional aspects of the Church.

When Pope Benedict XVI issued the Moto Proprio “Summorum Pontificum”, he truly brought peace and balance between the traditionalists and the modernists. His efforts were aimed at fostering unity within the Church, allowing space for both forms of the Mass. However, Pope Francis, probably because of his Jesuit background, doesn’t seem to favor the traditional liturgies of the Roman Catholic Church. He decided to ban the Traditional Latin Mass with “Traditionis Custodes”, which caused quite a stir within the community and left many traditionalists feeling marginalized.

So I think Pope Leo XIV will cancel the “Traditionis Custodes”.

Will it truly happen? I don’t know; the only method to make it happen is to keep praying! As the faithful continue to express their devotion and desire for the traditional liturgy, it will be interesting to see how this unfolds under his papacy.

The prayerful support from the community may play a vital role in influencing whatever decisions he may ultimately make regarding the liturgical practices of the Church.
