Many of you may know that I currently serve at the Tridentine Latin Mass for the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX) community here in Hong Kong. You might wonder why I choose to attend and serve at the SSPX Latin Mass, so I would like to share my experiences and motivations.

Let me begin by introducing the SSPX community in Hong Kong.

The SSPX community here is quite small. Due to their "canonical irregularity" within the Roman Catholic Church, they do not have their own church or chapel. Instead, they gather in a modest conference room inside a hotel, which is temporarily transformed into a chapel for Mass. Despite the humble setting, the community is dedicated and reverent, striving to preserve the traditional liturgy and practices of the Church.

Public Mass is held only once a month, as the priest is usually able to come to Hong Kong just once a month from different locations. This infrequency makes each gathering especially meaningful for the faithful.

Most of the attendees at the SSPX Latin Mass in Hong Kong are Filipino domestic workers. There are also some foreigners and even Chinese from Mainland China. As for Hong Kong locals, there are only a few of us, myself included. Despite our small numbers, the sense of unity and shared faith is strong.

Serving at the SSPX Latin Mass has deepened my appreciation for the beauty and solemnity of the traditional liturgy. The sense of reverence, the use of Latin, and the rich symbolism all contribute to a profound spiritual experience. Even though our community is small and lacks a permanent place of worship, the commitment and faith of its members are truly inspiring. This environment has strengthened my own faith and motivated me to serve with greater devotion.

Now, I would like to share how I became the Altar Server for the SSPX Community in Hong Kong.

I remember being invited by a friend, a fellow Hong Kong local, to attend the SSPX Latin Mass on Christmas Day last year. When I arrived at the temporary chapel and began praying before the Holy Mass, one of the helpers approached me and asked:

"Excuse me, do you know how to serve the Latin Mass?"

I replied, "Yes." The helper then said, "Can you serve today's Mass? Because we don't have an Altar Server!"

I agreed, "Sure!"

I was very grateful that the priest allowed me to assist him at that Christmas Mass. Afterward, the helper thanked me for serving and asked if I could help them once a month. I was delighted to accept this invitation.

Unfortunately, many local Catholics think I am in schism because they believe the SSPX is in schism. However, I want to clarify that the SSPX is not in schism; their excommunication was lifted many years ago, although they are still not in full communion with the Vatican. I sincerely hope that one day the SSPX will be fully reconciled with the Roman Catholic Church.

Serving at the SSPX Latin Mass has been a blessing in my life. It has allowed me to witness the dedication of a small but faithful community, to experience the richness of the traditional liturgy, and to grow in my own faith. I am grateful for the opportunity to serve and to be part of this unique community in Hong Kong.
