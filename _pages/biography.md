My name is Chavez L. H. Poon, my baptismal name is “Cyrillus Mariae”, I was born in Hong Kong in 14th of June in the year of 2003 during the SARS Pandemic, my childhood imagination was divided between the historical church buildings and the sacred arts, when I was in primary school, under the influence of the Catholic culture inside the school, I was baptised as Roman Catholic in the year of 2012, at that time I was 8th years old.

When I was in college, I started to think of my vocation to becoming a priest, but I think it is impossible to me as I think I did not have to power and strength to attend the priestly formation, but God has given me his miraculous plan, either becoming a priest or living in a normal life as a layperson.

For some reason, I started to explore the Western Rite aka Latin Rite liturgies of the Catholic Church, and I’m a experienced Ceremoniere (Liturgical Master of Ceremonies) for over 10 years, I have mainly serving the Holy Mass or other liturgical ceremonies as Ceremoniere by any invitations or private appointments. I also made some liturgical books such as Order of Holy Mass and other items, for example Altar Cards.

Since January 2023, I joined the Confraternity of St. Peter (Latin: Confraternitas Sancti Petri / Abbreviation: CSP), which is a sodality of members who wish to unite themselves to the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter and aid in the work of the fraternity, primarily by their own daily prayers.

Aside from my religion, I’m an Information Technology enthusiast since my days back in primary school, I love collecting old computers and operating systems, which is one of my hobbies.

Of course, not every single day in my life is a good day, somedays I return home I feel disappointed, when I look back at my life, I realize God has already uniquely prepared the path for me and guides me every single step of the way. I give thanks to God for so many wonderful people who support me in my spiritual life, to love me, comfort me, encourage me and pray for me.

And I also give thanks to God for all that I have and all that I am, especially for over 10 years as a Roman Catholic. I feel so blessed, happy and contented.
